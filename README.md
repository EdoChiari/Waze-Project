## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis and predictive modeling approach to support Waze's efforts to improve user retention. By examining churn-related data, this analysis aims to understand user behavior patterns and identify factors that contribute to monthly churn. Insights from this project will empower Waze leadership to make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience, proactively engage at-risk users, and support long-term growth.

## Project Goals
1. **Predict User Churn**: Develop and evaluate models to accurately predict which users are likely to churn, enabling Waze to focus retention efforts where they are needed most.
2. **Identify Key Drivers of Churn**: Pinpoint critical features such as app usage frequency, interaction patterns, and geographic location that influence user retention.
3. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer insights for Wazeâ€™s leadership to inform product development and enhance user engagement strategies.

## Deliverables
The final project deliverables include:

- **Model Evaluation**: Thorough assessment of model performance, including accuracy, precision, and recall, with an emphasis on interpreting metrics in the context of predicting churn.
- **Data Visualizations**: Clear visualizations to communicate churn trends and user patterns effectively, aiding stakeholders in understanding the factors that influence churn.
- **Feature Analysis**: Examination of which features most strongly impact churn likelihood, including possible underlying reasons (e.g., infrequent app usage or low engagement).
- **Retention Strategy Recommendations**: Suggestions for feature engineering, personalized user retention tactics, and other data-driven recommendations to enhance user experience and prevent churn.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for classification and regression models)
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Data gathering, cleaning, and processing to prepare a comprehensive dataset suitable for modeling and analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth exploration of churn data, including user engagement trends, to identify significant factors that impact retention.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of additional features to enhance model accuracy, such as time since last app usage, and user engagement metrics.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical testing to validate findings and understand which factors have a significant influence on churn.
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Development of regression and classification models to predict churn and assess their performance on key metrics.
6. **Executive Summary**: A summary of findings and insights tailored for non-technical stakeholders, highlighting the potential impact on retention strategies.

## Conclusion
This project equips Waze leadership with valuable insights into churn behavior, offering a data-driven approach to optimize retention strategies and boost long-term user engagement. By combining robust data analysis with ethical considerations in model deployment, this project provides a responsible and impactful method for understanding and addressing user churn in a way that supports growth and enhances the user experience.
